Repo structure:
This repo contains three main elements:
1.	Data directory (“data”) which contains all input data for computational analysis and a readme file that contains more detailed information about each data file.
2.	Source code directory (“code”) which contains all necessary code for generating differential expressed gene list and generating three main plots in our study. A readme file is also included to specify the purpose of each code file.
3.	Readme file which contains information of the overall narrative of this project and explanation of the computational pipeline that leads to generation of the DEG lists and figures


Guide for recreating computational results:
1.	Ranked DEG Comparison Test
The ranked DEG comparison test reflects whether or not the overlapping genes between male and female DEGs are more highly differentially expressed compared to the non-overlapping genes. A plot was generated by first ranking the DEG dataset by p-value and compute the number of overlaps between the top 50 DEGs of male and female, then repeated for the top 100, 200… up to 900 genes.
A.	Start by downloading Female_published_DEG_list and MaleDEG_published_DEG_list in the data folder
B.	Run DEG_Rank_Test.ipynb in the code folder

2.	Differentially Expressed Gene List generation and comparison between male and female
A.	Download GSE102556_HumanMDD_fpkmtab.csv from the data folder
B.	Run Limma_deg_resampling.Rmd
Limma_deg_script_NAc.Rmd
Limma_deg_script_antins.Rmd
Limma_deg_script_ba11.Rmd
Limma_deg_script_ba25.Rmd
Limma_deg_script_ba89_dlPFC.Rmd
Limma_deg_script_subic.Rmd
C.	From the last step, six separate lists of DEG will be generated from all six brain regions included in the original dataset and for “antins”, resampling method will be applied for 1000 permutations to generate variations of DEG identification within the same sex, at the same brain region
D.	Download DEG comparision OG.ipynb
E.	Move all output files from step B to the same directory as the ipynb file from step D
F.	Run DEG comparision OG.ipynb
G.	Collect results of Male/Female DEG overlaps and probability density plots for the resampling step. 

3.	Multidimensional scaling (MDS) on new whole brain MDD gene expression profiling dataset
A.	Download GSE101521_totalRNA_counts.cvs.gz from the data folder, decompress once downloaded
B.	Run MDS_limma_seconddata.rmd, collect MDS plot from the pipeline
C.	Move .csv result file to the same directory as DEG comparison OG.ipynb
D.	Generate DEG comparison for the new dataset by running DEG comparison OG.ipynb
